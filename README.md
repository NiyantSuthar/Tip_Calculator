# Tip_Calculator_Application

A tip calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to enter
the bill amount, service rating, number of people, and type of meal. The application
then computes and displays the total tip amount, ensuring users can easily and
accurately split the tip based on service quality and meal type.
